## Why George Language?

GLang was made because beginner-friendly languages don’t have to be boring. GLang is:

- **Approachable:** Simple syntax and fun naming conventions to help users learn quick. Functions like `bark`, `chew`, and `uhoh` make coding more intuitive and playful.
- **Educational:** Teaches real programming concepts under the hood, like data structures (lists, strings) and collections such as hashmap.
- **All-In-One:** The `glang` binary includes the GLang runtime, package management, and component tools like `glang self update`

## Features

- 🐶 Whimsical, beginner-friendly syntax
- 📚 Built-in modules for math, strings, and more
- 💬 Easy-to-understand functions like `dig()`, `bury()`, and `uhoh()`
- 📦 Package management with `kennels` and extensibility with `fetch`
- 🌐 Open source and growing community
