# GeorgeLanguage
The simple programming language for everyone!

GeorgeLanguage was created to simplify programming syntax with common day to day language. Instead
of using `var` for variables, we use `smt` to represent a "something":

```
smt x = 10
```

To print a something, we use the `shoutout` keyword to represent "shouting out" something:

```
smt x = 10

shoutout(x) 
```

| Syntax                     | Purpose                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `smt [var_name] = [value]` | Assigning a variable               |
| `shoutout([value])`        | Printing an output to the terminal |
