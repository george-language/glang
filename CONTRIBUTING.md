# Contributing to GeorgeLanguage

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GLang! There are many ways to contribute
and we appreciate all of themüôè

The best way to get started is by asking for help in our [developers discussion](https://github.com/mpsoftwarefoundation/GeorgeLanguage/discussions/categories/developers-discussion) to see what developers are up to and how you can help.

We don't have developer documentation (yet) as we are in focus of _creating_ not _relying on the community_.

## "Issues" Section

Found a bug or issue? You can report them [here](https://github.com/mpsoftwarefoundation/GeorgeLanguage/issues).

We also have issue templates for documentation updates and feature requests.
