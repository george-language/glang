# Contributing to GeorgeLanguage

Hi there! Thanks for your interest in contributing to **GLang**, whether you're here to test, build, or just hang out, we're glad to have you on board. Every little bit helps, and we appreciate it all 🙏

## New Around Here?

The best way to get started is by joining the conversations in our [Developer Discussions](https://github.com/george-language/glang/discussions/categories/developers-discussion).
Ask questions, share ideas, or just see what others are working on (it's a great way to plug in!)

> [!NOTE]
> We don’t have full developer docs _yet_. Right now, we're focusing on **building** before we focus on **documenting**. GLang will always have a team behind it to keep it running.

## Want to Help Test?

GLang is updated regularly, so there’s always something new to explore!

You can:
- Run the built-in tests in `library/tests/`
- Build your own projects and push GLang to its limits

If you run into any bugs or quirks, check out the [Issues section](#-issues-section) below to learn how to report them.

## Want to Develop Kennels?

**Kennels** are GLang’s package system, introduced in version 2.3. Think of them as little doghouses full of awesome code!

- Learn what Kennels are: [About Kennels](https://george-language.github.io/docs/kennels/)
- Build your own: [Creating Kennels](https://george-language.github.io/docs/kennels/creating)

Even if you're not contributing directly to the main repo, creating Kennels helps the ecosystem grow and that’s a **huge** help!

## Issues Section

Found a bug? Got an idea? Want to tweak some docs?

- Report issues here: [GLang Issues](https://github.com/george-language/glang/issues)

Thanks again for helping make GLang better! Let’s build something cool together 👊
