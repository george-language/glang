# Contributing to GeorgeLanguage

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GLang! There are many ways to contribute
and we appreciate all of themüôè

The best way to get started is by asking for help in our [developers discussion](https://github.com/mpsoftwarefoundation/GeorgeLanguage/discussions/categories/developers-discussion) to see what developers are up to and how you can help.

We don't have developer documentation (yet) as we are in focus of _creating_ not _relying on the community_.

## Wanting To Help Test?

We update GLang on the regular, which means there are always new versions to try out. You can test GLang with the `library/tests/` folder included with GLang, or create your own projects pushing the limits!

If you find an issue, see more info below.

## Wanting To Develop Kennels?

Kennels is GLang's package system implemented in 2.3, you can learn more [here](https://sites.google.com/view/george-lang/documentation/standard-docs/kennels/about-kennels?authuser=0) or learn how to create your own [here](https://sites.google.com/view/george-lang/documentation/standard-docs/kennels/creating-kennels?authuser=0).

Even though it may not be contributing to the project directly, kennels **you create** help us strengthen GLang and grow it bigger üëç
