# file test_mutability.glang: test the list type's mutability

# adding a value to the list (this function also represents all other list operations)
obj list1 = [1, 2, 3];
push(list1, 4);

bark(list1); # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# creating a list based off the same list
obj list2 = list1;
push(list1, 5);

# list1 should have also been modified because list1 and list2 point to the same object
bark(list1); # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
